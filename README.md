## 🔮 What's Next
Vaultiva is built with a long-term plan to gradually enhance document protection, user experience, and enterprise readiness.

### 🥇 Stage 1 – Lockdown Basics (MVP)
- Proxy all file access via backend (token-based)
- Hard watermark rendering via backend (pdf-lib + Sharp)
- Watermark preview per recipient
- Replace <iframe> viewer with PDF.js
- Token-based session tracking
- Log PDF open event and last page viewed
- Basic JS protections (blur on tab out, disable right-click)
- Strengthened watermark rendering (positioning, rotating, opacity, content)

### 🥈 Stage 2 – UX & Try Vaultiva
- “Try Vaultiva Now” share demo
- “View as recipient” simulation
- Group file list by protection level
- Enhanced empty states and guidance messages

### 🥉 Stage 3 – Abuse Prevention & Performance
- Brute-force password protection
- IP-based upload/share limiting
- Compress dashboard thumbnails
- Optimize PDF and asset delivery via CDN

### 🧠 Stage 4 – AI & Smart Recovery
- Vaultiva Assistant (AI guide/helper)
- “Forgot password?” → reset suggestion or revoke flow

### 💎 Stage 5 – Enterprise-Grade Protections
- Server-side image rendering + watermark stamping (Sharp)
- Invisible metadata injection (user ID, timestamp, access info)
- Multi-device session logging
- PDF interaction heatmap & analytics
